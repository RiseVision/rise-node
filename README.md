<b>Install Rise (Mainnet)</b>

```

Go to the Rise directory
```
cd rise-node
```

```

Catch up with current mainnet (download snapshot: y)
```
./rise_manager.bash rebuild
```

Get node status
```

Insert your passphrase so you can forge:

```

And change this section to include your passphrase:
```
"forging": {
        "force": false,
        "secret": ["word1 word2 word3 ..."],
        "access": {
            "whiteList": [
                "127.0.0.1"
            ]
        }
    },
```

```
./rise_manager.bash reload
